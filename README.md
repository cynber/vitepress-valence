## Article / Blog Components

You can easily add blog, announcements, and similar sections to your VitePress site. After you add the data loader script to your site, adding new posts will be as simple as adding a new markdown file to a folder of your choice. This package includes beautiful and cohesive components that will make your blog look and feel great.
